# Lunar Client for Arm

This is a build of the Moonsworth Lunar Client for arm prceccors. Because Lunar Client's API does not support arm, I added some code that fetches your own java instead of lunars custom one.
There is also a script for automatically changing the lwjgl args for arm.

# Dependecies

Download the install script and run it.
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gl91306/lunar/master/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

Thats it!
