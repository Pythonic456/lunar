# lunar

This is a build of monnsworths Lunar Client for armvl prceccors. Because lunars api doesnt support arm, I added some code that fetches your own java instead of lunars custom one.
Theres also a script for automaticly changing lwjgl args for arm.

# Dependecies

you need to install jdk-8-defualt
also you need the 2 lwjgl folders https://github.com/mikehooper/Minecraft

Thats it!
