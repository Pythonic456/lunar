# Lunar Client for Arm

This is a build of the Moonsworth Lunar Client for arm prceccors. Because Lunar Client's API does not support arm, I added some code that fetches your own java instead of lunars custom one.
There is also a script for automatically changing the lwjgl args for arm.

# Dependecies

Clone the repository, make sure `git` is installed first
```
git clone https://github.com/gl91306/lunar
```

Change the directory, make script executable, and run it!
```
cd lunar
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

Thats it!
